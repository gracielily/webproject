                <h1>What is the Wild Area?</h1>
                <p>The Wild Area is the big open area in the Galar Region. It's connected to multiple towns and cities
                    and
                    features a diverse range of locations and styles including torn apart areas, lakes, fields and
                    more.</p>
                <p>This area has full camera control and allows for you to explore unincumbered by restrictions in the
                    areas.
                    However, you will often find Pokémon higher than you can catch it. These can be good to battle for
                    experience
                    but will not be able to be caught or be shiny.</p>
                <p>Throughout the Wild Area you may also find Pokémon Dens that house Max Raid Battles.</p>

                <p>You will encounter wild Pokémon on the field in the Wild Areas. However, the Pokémon you encounter
                    will
                    vary depending on your location in the Wild Area as well as the weather. If it's raining, for
                    example,
                    more Water-type Pokémon will appear</p>

                <h3>Some Pokémon you will meet in the Wild Area include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Pikachu</li>
                    <li>- Snorlax</li>
                    <li>- Gyrados</li>
                    <li>- Butterfree</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Pokémon typically react differently to you based on the species. Some will charge at you, others will
                    run away. You can approach them slowly using the Control Stick or whistle to attract their
                    attention.</p>

            <h1 class="white-text align-center">Weather</h1>
            <p class="white-text">The weather in the Wild Area determines
                which wild Pokémon can appear and, in some cases, which weather
                conditions and terrain appear in battle. The weather varies between subareas, and while neighboring
                subeareas can share the same weather, the weather in each is independently determined. However,
                since
                symbol encounters and wanderers spawn based on the weather currently experienced by players, it is
                possible
                for the weather of one subarea to affect these spawns in another subarea if players are near the
                border
                between them. The weather across the entire Wild Area changes each day at midnight.</p>

            <p>While in the Wild Area, you may come across glowing <strong>Pokemon Dens</strong>. When this spot gives off a
                pillar of
                light, it means a <strong>Dynamax Pokemon</strong> is hiding there.</p>

            <p>Approaching the Pokemon Den and interacting with it will let you challenge the Dynamax Pokemon inside,
                which will vary by species and strength based on location and weather. You won't know exactly what the
                Pokemon inside is, but you'll be given a shadow outline of that Pokemon as well as its type.</p>
