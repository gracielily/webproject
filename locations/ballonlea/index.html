    <h1>A Steam Powered Marvel</h1>
    <p>Ballonlea is a small, secluded town situated in a dense forest in the northwestern Galar region. The town's sole access route via land is through Glimwood Tangle, which is located to the south. The town is surrounded by towering trees and its paths are lined by many glowing mushrooms. The houses in Ballonlea resemble the design of common half-timbered cottages in traditional Tudor architecture.</p>
    <p>Due to being nestled within a forest, Ballonlea is quite dark; the glowing mushrooms provide most of the light outside.</p>
